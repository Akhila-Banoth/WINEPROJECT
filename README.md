Wine is an open-source project that provides a compatibility layer used to run Windows applications on other operating systems such as macOS, Linux, and ChromeOS.

Wine works differently than other "emulation" software. Instead of running a version of Windows "in a bubble" inside your macOS or Linux environment, Wine is an intermediary. It translates Windows instructions into macOS or Linux instructions directly. That means when you open your Windows application, it will run faster and smoother than it would through an emulator.
